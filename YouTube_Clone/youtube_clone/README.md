# Getting Started with Create React App

The project was done to clone youtube website using React Function components.

Currently video thumbnails are being displayed instead of videos.

Thumbnails for the videos were downloaded from the site "https://www.getyoutubevideothumbnail.com/" using the video url taken from youtube site

Icons for the header and sidemenu components were downloaded from the site "https://iconscout.com/icons/live"

All the js files have been placed in their corresponging compent folders under src folder

Downloaded Icons and Images are placed under public/images folder.

react-dom-component was installed to add router functionality to the project.

Entering text into the searchbox in the header redirects to a static search result page currently which displays videos preloaded into the page.

Empty search box does not show any results on the search page.

Clicking on the YouTube logo icon redirects to "Home Page"
